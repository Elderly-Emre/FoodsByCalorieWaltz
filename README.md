## Foods by 'Calorie Waltz'
Selection of foods I think looks tasty :yum:

## Description
Some designs came out of my head, some are 'inspired' by others. This food pack is not exactly balanced or anything, I just googled calories for real life analogies and slapped those in. If someone wants to balance things out - be my guest.

Most of the spawns are not made by me, so don't praise me if they are amazing. I only made spawns for HRV and half of Milton - if you like those but not the others - tell me so I feel inspired to do more. 

There's a tiny bit of unfinished 'lore'.

## Installation
It's a standard modcomponent pack, so just throw it in `...Mods/`

Requires [ModComponent](https://github.com/ds5678/ModComponent/releases). 

## Shoutout
[@ds5678](https://github.com/ds5678) and another mystery person for helping with setting up most of the spawn points.
